# GitHub Pages Site

This is the repo to the GitHub Pages site that shows off a small collection of mini-graphical things I've taken from the basics of my University degree and from just generally surfing the web for interesting 'things'.

Hopefully showing off my combination of hard skills from employment and eccentric interests. A curiosity box.
